## Overview

**Python-Keylogger** is a simple keylogging program written in Python. It logs keystrokes from a keyboard and stores the information in a text file. The program is designed with security and educational purposes in mind, and it provides real-time feedback via the terminal to discourage any illegal use. 

The keylogger is built using the `pynput` library, which listens for keyboard events in real-time. The program is fully customizable and can be used in controlled environments to test or monitor your own system.

## Features

- **Keylogging**: Records all keystrokes, including alphanumeric characters and special keys (e.g., space, enter, shift).
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays typed keys in the terminal for user awareness and transparency.
- **Logging to File**: All captured keys are logged to a text file (`keylog.txt`), making it easy to review recorded data.
- **Ethical Use Warning**: Displays a clear disclaimer to remind users that this tool is for educational and ethical use only.
